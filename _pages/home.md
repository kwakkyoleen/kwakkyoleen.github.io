### About Me

I am a graduate student in the Department of Artificial Intelligence at **Kyung Hee University**, where I am pursuing my M.Sc. under the supervision of **Prof. Hyo Seok Hwang** in the **AIRLab**. 

I graduated from Kyung Hee University in 2024 with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, and my current research focuses on **reinforcement learning** and its applications in **robot control**. 

My primary interest lies in developing intelligent algorithms that enable robots to perform complex tasks in dynamic environments. I am particularly fascinated by the intersection of AI and robotics, where theoretical advancements meet practical implementations. Through my research, I aim to contribute to the field of autonomous systems and their integration into real-world applications.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I enjoy collaborating on innovative projects and engaging in discussions about the future of artificial intelligence and robotics.
